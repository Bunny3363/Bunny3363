# Who Am I? ðŸ¤–âœ¨

I am an **AI Systems Architect** specializing in building production-grade, highly scalable, and secure AI systems. My work focuses on end-to-end engineering that delivers optimized, cost-efficient, and well-monitored solutionsâ€”both for training and inference of large language models (LLMs).

Iâ€™m passionate about designing evaluation-driven architectures and robust ML/LLM system design patterns, including Agent Patterns. I dive deep into topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), distributed fine-tuning, and efficient inference hosting to ensure our systems can serve millionsâ€”or even billionsâ€”of users. ðŸ“ˆðŸš€

If youâ€™re looking for someone who can bridge cutting-edge research with production-ready engineering practices, Iâ€™m your person!
